Welcome to the Pong Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using C++ and the Raylib library. In this game, two players can control paddles to hit the ball back and forth, aiming to score points against each other.

# Installation
To play the Pong Game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. **Install Raylib:** <br>
Make sure you have Raylib installed on your system. If not, you can follow the instructions on the [Raylib GitHub repository](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-Windows) to install it.

4. **Compile and Run:**

# How to Play
**Player 1**: Use the **'W'** and **'S'** keys to move the left paddle up and down, respectively. <br>
